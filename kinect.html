            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>Kinect is an educational platform for children aged 5-12 that encourages hands-on learning and creativity
                across topics such as art, writing, life skills, and science. It connects children with a global
                community
                in a safe, AI-free environment, allowing them to share their work, collaborate, and learn through doing
                rather than consuming.
                <br><br>
                This project prototype was developed under 24 hours as part of a hackathon-styled compteition called
                Ideathon.

        <div class="ProjSection">

            <h2 class="prompt">The Prompt</h2>
            <p>Design an app that creates safer, more authentic online communities that promote healthy digital
                interactions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="ProjSection">
            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p> We conducted user research by interviewing parents to understand their concerns regarding children's
                engagement with technology. We explored competitors such as DIY.org and analyzed cultural and
                accessibility
                gaps. Insights from these studies helped us define user needs and design a solution that balances
                creativity, learning, and safety.
            </p>

            <br>
            Our insights based on interviews and competitive analysis:
            <ul>
                <li>Kids need to be hands-on</li>
                <li>Kids need less exposure to harmful media and more safety features</li>
                <li>Parents dislike children's dependance on AI and lack of creativity</li>
                <li>Kids tend to desire gamification</li>
                <li>There is a market gap when it comes to a global perspective in kid-focused apps</li>
            </ul>
        </div>


        <div class="ProjSection">
            <h2>Design</h2>
            <p> We developed an information architechture diagram on Miro to get an idea of what pages we need
                and
                how
                they relate, keeping ideal user flows in mind. However, what made this process different was the
                fact
                that we had to prioritize which
                screens are most important to develop in our final protoype due to our time contraint in the
                competition.
                After that, we developed rough wireframe sketches of our MVP screens before moving to Figma to
                create
                high-fidelity wireframes and prototypes.

        </div>

        <div class="ProjSection">
            <h2>Prototype</h2>
            <p> We created an interactive prototype in Figma that showcases the main user flows of our app,
                including
                the login, an interactive map showcasing what countries other users are posting from, an explore
                page,
                and a creative studio to post based on prompts and fun topics.
                <br><br>
                The UI is inspired by 2000's childrens books. The UI contains vibrant colors,an uncluttered
                layout,
                and
                large text
                to make it more accessible and easy to understand for young users. The explore page only allows
                for
                limited emoji reactions to ensure a safe community and no opportunity for bullying. Badges
                gamify
                the
                app, incentifiving kids to take on fun projects and engage with other users.<br>
                The map page and filter system allows children to gain exposure to other parts of the world, and
                learn
                more about the world they live in outside their immediate environment; a major feature that
                adresses
                a
                gap in current kid-focused platforms. <br>
                Important features that are part of our launch plan include an automated screening system that
                flags
                and
                removes
                harmful content children might post.

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>We spent a lot of time refining our idea to ensure that it not only stood out, but also addressed
                the
                needs of both children and their parents. We had some technical challenges concerning Figma and
                our
                time
                frame as well. We have found solutions to those technicalities that we want to address soon.
                <br><br>
                Half of us were using Figma for the first time, and are very proud of learning the tool and
                developing
                this prototype under such a short time frame. We are also proud of addressing such a current and
                prevalent concern that could make a difference in families' lives.

                <br><br>
                We learned a lot about user-centered design, collaborating with new people and managing tasks as
                a
                team.
                We also learned a lot during our research about the current state of creativity decline and the
                issues
                with children being exposed to technology.

                <br><br>
                The next steps are to conduct usability studies on the prototype with kids to ensure that the
                product
                suits them, and reiterate. We will then develop the working app, launch it on the play store and
                apple
                store, and advertise to families across the globe. We want to offer more accessibilty and
                engagement
                features, such as screen readers and hosted events.
