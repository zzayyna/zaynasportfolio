            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            Mind Splurge is a UX design project I completed as part of the Google UX Design Certificate program. Mind
            Splurge is a California based museum that focuses on the intersection of Art & Psychology.
            <br><br>
            <p><b>The Problem:</b> People don’t have an easy way to book visits or gather info about the museum without
                navigating third party platforms or speaking directly to a representative.
                <br><br>
                <b>The Goal:</b> Creative a single, simple platform where people can get info about the museum, its
                work,
                its events, and book tickets.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="ProjSection">
            <h2>The Prompt</h2>
            <p>Design an app and a responsive website for a public art museum to advertise exhibitions and
                events, provide museum information to patrons, and enable patrons to schedule visits.
                <br><br>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="ProjSection">
            <h2>Phase 1: Understand</h2>
            <p>
                Conducted qualitative and quantitative research to understand user needs and pain points. This included
                general user interviews, and research of first hand experiences online.<br><br> I then conducted a
                compeitive
                audit of five direct and indirect museums/experiences in the US and San Diego, noting their strengths
                and
                weaknesses, gaps, and ticket booking processes.
                <br><br>Some insights from my research include the following:
            <ul>
                <li>A step by step ticket booking process is preferred, but with as few steps as possible</li>
                <li>Compeitiors have lots of images and info</li>
                <li>Some competitors tend to have cluttered, overwhelming, hard to navigate interfaces</li>
                <li>Some gaps include: The offering of numerous languages, and interactivity with other museum-goers
                    (like a community forum)
                </li>
                </p>
        </div>

        <div class="ProjSection">
            <h2>Phase 2: Define</h2>
            <p>
                After my research, I created user personas to represent the target audience for Mind Splurge. These
                personas
                helped me
                empathize with users and keep their needs in mind throughout the design process.
                <br><br>

                <div class="persona">
                    <img src="assets/jesse.jpg" height="200px">
                    <p><b>Jesse Carpenter: </b>A 67 year old retired IT engineer, and an avid art lover living in San
                        Diego.
                        He
                        enjoys spending time with his two grandchildren and wants to take them to the museum , but he
                        has
                        reading problems.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="persona">
                    <img src="assets/ida.jpg" height="200px">
                    <p><b>Ida Neumann: </b> A 29 year old high school counselor from Stuttgard, Germany. Her school is
                        visiting California for a tip, and she wants to take them to this museum. She is limited by her
                        budget, and is unfamilar with the area and not fluent in English.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            I then created user journey maps to visualize the steps users would take to book tickets and access
            information on the app and website. This helped me identify pain points and areas for improvement in the
            information gathering and ticket booking processes.
            <br><br>
            Finally, I developed my user flow diagrams to outline the specific tasks users would need to complete on
            the app. <br><br>

        <div class="ProjSection">
            <h2>Phase 3: Ideate</h2>
            <p>
                This then allowed me to devlop a storyboard to outline the key features and functionalities of the app
                and website. I focused on the persona Ida, our German persona, as she goes struggles to book tickets for
                the
                school trip without a centralized website vs the process she would undergo <i>with</i> the website.

                <br><br><br>
                Finally, I narrowed my information architechture diagram to focus on the most essential pages and
                features for the website based on my user flows, personas, and storyboard.

        <div class="ProjSection">
            <h2>Phase 4: Design</h2>
            <p>
                At this point, I was ready to start designing low-fidelity wireframes for the website. I created a few
                iterations of paper wireframes, focused on a simple, easy to scan layout with clear but informative
                navigation. I then finalized one, which i tranferred into a low-fidelity figma protoype.

        <div class="ProjSection">
            <h2>Phase 5: Test</h2>
            <p>
                I was now ready to conduct usability testing on my low-fidelity prototype. I recruited 5
                participants
                who fit my user personas, and had them complete a series of tasks using the prototype while thinking
                aloud. I observed their interactions and took notes on their feedback.
                <br><br>
                These are some of the main insights I found:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Users want everything in nav bar. It helps users complete tasks
                    faster.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Im lazy, i dont like scrolling" - Participant 1</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Users want noticeable CTA’s, such as a more noticable button for booking</li>
                <li>Users find the UI too large (Want to avoid scrolling at all during ticket booking process)</li>
                <li>Users rated most tasks easy to complete, rating most a 1 on a scale of 1 to 3 (1 being easiest)
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="ProjSection">
            <h2>Phase 6: High-Fi Mockups</h2>
            <p> Taking my feedback into account, I created high-fidelity mockups of the website in Figma. I focused on
                improving the navigation by finalizing a persistent nav bar with all key pages, making the call to
                action buttons
                more noticable, and condensing information/resizing UI components to reduce scrolling (especially during
                the
                ticket booking process.)

                <br><br>I developed a UI with paint splatter motifs to match the artistic and creative vibe of the
                museum,
                while keeping a clean, simple layout with lots of negative space for easy scanning.

                <br><br>I conducted another round of usability testing with 5 new participants using the high-fidelity
                prototype, and made a few more changes, such as adding a calendar view for ticket booking.

            <h2>Reflection and Future Goals</h2>
            <p>
                This project was an amazing practice and introduction to hands-on UX skills. This was my first time
                working on a full UX project from start to finish, and I learned a lot about using Figma (my first time
                using it!), methods of putting myself in the end-users shoes, and iterating based on feedback. <br><br>
                I'm proud of the final product, and would love to continue working on it in the future by conducting
                more
                usability testing with a larger and more diverse group of participants, adding more accessibility
                features, and need to develop a responsive mobile version of the product!
