            <p>Rooted is a final brand design project for my Graphic Design class. The fictional company is a grunge and
                gritty tea company. Rooted has one
                ingredient: raw tea leaves. That’s it.
                No junk. No additives. No lies.
                They're here to provide real tea that tastes good and
                fuels your body, not poison it.

            <h2>Logo Design</h2>
            <p>
                The logo is inspired by roots and nature, with a rough and hand-drawn aesthetic to reflect the brand's
                gritty and authentic attitude. The typography is bold and organic, emphasizing the brand's commitment to
                real and raw ingredients.

                We started by drafting 25 logo concepts on paper (logo matrix).<br><br>
                Then, took those ideas onto Adobe Illustrator going through three rounds of logo designs, with professor
                and peer feedback on each. A total of 6 logos drafted on Illustrator. <br><br>Below are my concepts from
                round
                1, and the final logo I ended up with!

                    The business cards are dark, and feature the adapted logo on the front, with a textured overlay to
                    reflect
                    the earthy and
                    natural vibe of the brand. The back includes contact information in a clean and simple layout.

                    The instagram ad was designed to capture attention with its bold typography, punk aesthetics and

                <p>
                    FOr the product packaging, I wanted it o reflect the grunge and gritty language of the brand, bring
                    that in the emblem styled logo and rough overlay to catch a customers eye in the store, and use that
                    punk language in tagline and directions. <br><br>
                    My first iteration of the packahing was different, a little too minimalistic, but I recieved
                    feedback from mt professor to lean into the loud and grunge aesthetic, make the elements larger,
                    rougher, and so that's exactly what I did and I love it so much more.

                    Finally, I created a brand guidelines booklet to showcase Rooted's mission visual identity,
                    including logo
                    usage, color palette, typography, and imagery style.

                <p>
                    This project was so much fun to work on, and I really enjoyed being able to create a brand from
                    scratch. I
                    learned a lot about the design process, and how to take feedback and iterate on my designs. I also
                    learned
                    a lot about branding, and how to create a cohesive visual identity for a company. <br><br> It was
                    especially
                    challenging to go in the loud and punk direction, learning to overcome my fear of taking risks in
                    designs and not falling into the minimalistic trap. <br><br>Overall, I'm
                    really proud of
                    the work I did on this project, and truly believe that I've grown as a designer.
